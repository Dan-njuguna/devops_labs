## Log Archive Tool

- Reads from standard input the user input for the logs directory.
- Compresses all the logs found in that path.
- Clears the logs(dangerous for system logs. Don't nuke!)

For system logs under `/var/log` path, run command as super user to ensure no errors while running command
happy coding
